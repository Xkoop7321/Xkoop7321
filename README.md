Hi, I'm Xkoop7321, I develop sm64 rom hacks and figured out a lot of non decomp things in hex.

- I'm the boss of the shoshie project development and if you think it's trash thats not my problem because I spent countless months of research on it.

- I am working on a smb1 build that functions like an arcade and i'm planning on porting it to real arcade hardware.
